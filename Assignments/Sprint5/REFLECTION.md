I did a fair bit of research and work to get this to work as it does.  Currently the application is deployed on an aws server and runs 
a ASP.net web app.  The login does not quite work on the server but worked as intended locally.  When you try to login on the server
it pops to the google login, after you put in the information / choose which account it encounters an error.  Locally it logs in as intended.
There were many issues I encountered when attempting to deploy this to the server.  I had to configure the server and download the proper
server hosting software packages.  Once the login is working I will try to get it to display some account information (email or name) on 
the main page.
