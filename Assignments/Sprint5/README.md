I decided to impliment this project with other technologies.  I use an ASP.net server running on an amazon EC2 server.  Contained in this
repo is a zip file containing the virtual studios project file.  This project is deployed on the amazon server 
here: http://ec2-3-23-111-67.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ To run the program locally just load it into virtual studios.
The login will work if it runs on the default virtual studios IIS at https://localhost:44379
