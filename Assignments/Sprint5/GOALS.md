My goal with this project is to use googles SSO login and deploy it to an amazon server.  I chose to do this with ASP.net instead of 
python/flask because I have done python/flask before and we were allowed to use other technologies.  I understand this means I will have
less support from the class because I am not following the tutorial.  However I wanted to learn something new and still complete the 
assignment and learn about SSO.  The project is supposed to login through google OAUTH and then display some data on the main page.  
Intended audience is me and is for educational purposes.
