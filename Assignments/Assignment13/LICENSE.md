I found the MIT license to be the most open license.  It allows anyone to take the code, alter it, sell it, or basically do anything with
it.  This is what I would choose to use because it is simple and people to take the project and make something profitable with it.  This 
is better than other licenses because it is very clear what you can do with it.  That being the case, companies may be more inclined to 
further the project or use it themself for something usefull.
