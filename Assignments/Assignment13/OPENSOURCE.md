I did not realise that it was common for companies to pay their employees to work on open source projects.  I can understand why 
individuals would participate to give them a showcase of what they have done, but companies participating was not something I anticipated 
much.  I really dont think reputation would be much of a factor for participating in open source projects though.  Not many people see who 
does what so I dont think much reputation would be gained.
