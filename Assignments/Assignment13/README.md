Created the login with visual studios.  To run the project just open up the folder as a visual studios project.  It is a ASP.net site
using Oauth to give a google login.  For now the google login will only work if ran from https://localhost:44379.  This will not be a 
problem once it is moved to the aws server, but for now it persists. Mostly it is just the default ASP.net stuff that Vstudios provides,
only difference is it has the google login working on my end.
